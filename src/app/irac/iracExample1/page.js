        <h2>Example: Trespass to Land</h2>

        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>Did Alex commit trespass when he entered Jamie's fenced garden without permission?</p>

        <h3>Rule</h3>
        <p>Under UK law, trespass to land occurs when a person intentionally enters land that is in possession of another without lawful justification (Entick v Carrington (1765) 19 St Tr 1029).</p>

        <h3>Application</h3>
        <p>Alex entered Jamieâ€™s fenced garden despite a visible "Private Property" sign. He was not invited nor had legal authority. His entry was voluntary and unjustified.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Alex likely committed trespass to land under UK common law.</p>
